    <h1> About </h1>
    <p> This repository's purpose is to play around with HTML5 elements that I have never used before. I also plan on documenting and exemplifying each one. For example, here I am using the <code> &lt;section&gt; </code> element to structure my webpage. I consider myself to have a one track mind when it comes to learning, and I figure it's time to go back to the foundation of web development; HTML. </p>
